            <h2> 1984 </h2>
            <p>
              Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel by English novelist George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, Nineteen Eighty-Four centres on the consequences of government over-reach, totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of all persons and behaviours within society.[2][3] More broadly, it examines the role of truth and facts within politics and their manipulation.

            <p>
              Shoe Dog[2] is a memoir by Nike co-founder Phil Knight.[3] The memoir chronicles the history of Nike from its early struggles to its evolution into one of the world’s most recognized and profitable companies. Bill Gates named Shoe Dog one of his five favorite books of 2016 and called it “an amazing tale, a refreshingly honest reminder of what the path to business success really looks like. It’s a messy, perilous, and chaotic journey, riddled with mistakes, endless struggles, and sacrifice. Phil Knight opens up in ways few CEOs are willing to do.”
